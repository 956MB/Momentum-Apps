# USB Game Controller for Flipper Zero
This is an app for the Flipper Zero that emulates a game controller (specifically the Xbox 360 controller) and lets the user interact with the emulated joystick, A and B buttons.
It also contains a full implementation of XInput for the Flipper Zero that supports every input that a regular Xbox controller does, which you may use in other applications.
