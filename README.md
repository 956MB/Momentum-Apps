# Flipper-Zero-Radio-Scanner

## ðŸ“»
Scans frequencies available to the CC1101 and plays them over the speaker so you can hear them.
Does NOT play "FM radio stations" since those frequencies are not available.

## ðŸ¤”ToDo
- Need to hop over CC1101 frequency gaps. Currently crashes when scanning an out-of-range frequency.
- Currently using FM238 (FuriHalSubGhzPreset2FSKDev238Async) but per CodeAllNight a custom preset can be used to improve audio.
